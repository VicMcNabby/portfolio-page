    The projects below are a few of my favorites. They are presented in chronological order based on when they were created. While I am proud of all of them, I also think they are a good display of just how far I've come in my programming education. I continue
    to learn more each day, and look forward to what projects and oppurtunities the future holds. Please enjoy!</p>

        'Flizz' is a multimedia search engine designed to display the top results for 'books', 'movies', and 'games' of a particular search parameter. Each individual result will display an image and brief description. Also, an Amazon link will be attached to
        each result as well as media specific links, such as the platforms available for each game, or a link to the trailer for each movie. The goal of this app is to introduce the user to different ways to consume their favorite topics. first substantial

      <p class="projectDescription">
        'Jello' is a workflow organization app for teams and/or individuals. We envision this app will be used by developers, or any team based environment to maintain organization. 'Jello' will allow the user to see a visual representation of their tasks organized
        by priority, enable them to create new projects, and assist in assigning tasks/stories to a particular user.. This was a four member group project completed in a weeks time. We set out to create our own version of a 'Trello' type application.

      <p class="projectDescription">
        'RegXpress' is real time contest between one or more players where the goal is to accumulate points by solving complex, scenario based word pattern problems using regex. Socket.IO was used in order to enable the realtime communication between multiple
        users. For our front-end framework, we used AngularJS to bring our app to fruition. This was a group collaboration between myself and three other classmates. We followed the agile workflow and used feature branching on Github to avoid merge conflicts.</p>
